# Calorie Tracker

A modern calorie tracker built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This application empowers users to monitor their daily calorie intake and calories burned by adding two types of activities: food and exercise.

## Description

The Calorie Tracker app lets users log two kinds of activities:

- **Food:** Record the name and calories of meals or snacks to track calories consumed.
- **Exercise:** Log workouts or physical activities along with the calories burned.

Each activity is displayed on individual cards, making it easy to review your daily entries. A banner at the top shows a summary of your activities by displaying:
- Total calories consumed (from food),
- Total calories burned (from exercise), and
- The net sum of both, giving you an at-a-glance view of your calorie balance.

This project is an excellent example of how to build a dynamic and responsive web application using modern technologies and best practices.

## Features

- **Activity Logging:**  
  Add activities by selecting the type (Food or Exercise), entering the name, and specifying the calorie value.
- **Visual Display:**  
  Each activity is presented on a card with clear, concise details.
- **Calorie Summary Banner:**  
  View the total calories consumed, burned, and the net result in one unified banner.
- **Modern Tooling:**  
  Built using React for a dynamic UI, TypeScript for robust code, Vite for rapid development, and Tailwind CSS for modern styling.
